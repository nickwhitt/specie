This site is a passion project for a numismatic collection of (primarily US) coins.
Type and issue lists will occasionally have markers (
[âˆš]{.text-(--ui-success)}, <ProseChip></ProseChip>, <ProseBadge>AU</ProseBadge>
) which indicate a piece in my collection. It is my intent that these markers are
unubtrousive and easily ignored.

## Federal Coinage

Our currency today is a form  of **fiat money**: its value is what we agree to say
it's worth, regardless of its actual composition. You can go to a bank and exchange
any combination of coins and bills for any other combination of equal value. You
cannot, however, exchange it for precious metals like gold or silver; though you
could at one time. Originally, federal coinage was **commodity money** composed of
its intrinsic value in precious metal: one silver dollar contained one dollar's worth
of silver.

### Bimetalic Standard

Federal coinage was defined by **The Coinage Act of 1792**, which officially regulated
the purity and weight (standard) of each specie to be minted by the United States:

- 270 grains (17.50 grams) of 22 carat gold for the eagle
- 416 grains (26.96 grams) of .8924 silver for the dollar
- 264 grains (17.11 grams) of pure copper for the cent

Fractional coins were set to be the equivalent fraction of weight with the same
composition: the gold half eagle weighed 135 grains (8.75 grams), and the silver
quarter dollar weighed 104 grains (6.74 grams). This was all based on a fixed ratio
of 15 units of pure silver to 1 unit of pure gold: thirty silver dollars containing
11,137.5 grains of pure silver was equivalent to three gold eagles containing 742.5
grains of pure gold.

Trade and speculation often took the standard-weight dollars and eagles to foreign
shores, where they were quickly melted down for their bullion value. **The Coinage
Act of 1834** redefined the fixed ratio of silver-to-gold as 16:1, and reduced the
standard gold purity from .9167 (22 carat) to .8992.

**The Act of January 18, 1837** further regulated the purity and weight of federal
specie as such:

- 258 grains (16.72 grams) of .900 gold for the eagle
- 412.5 grains (26.73 grams) of .900 silver for the dollar
- 168 grains (10.89 grams) of pure copper for the cent [^1]

[^1]: The cent had already been reduced first to 208 grains (13.48 grams) in 1793, then
to 168 grains (10.89 grams) in 1796.

These adjustments to silver and gold coinage were a boon for trade and business, and
specie began to truly circulate for the first time in US history. At least, until
the California gold discovery in 1848 disrupted world markets.

### Debased Silver

A deluge of gold ore from California and Australia had the effect of drastically
raising the comparitive value of silver, resulting in silver specie being hoarded
for their bullion worth. With the demand for a three-cent piece in 1851, Congress
authorized the first subsidiary silver coin in circulation: at 12-3/8 grains (.80
grams) of .750 silver, the coin was worth more in face value than its silver content.
This was followed by **The Coinage Act of 1853** which reduced the weight of the
half dollar to 192 grains (12.44 grams), with other fractional silver coins being
reduced by their equivalent fraction of weight. Copper cents were made subsidiary
with **The Coinage Act of 1857**, reducing the standard of one cent to 72 grains
(4.67 grams) of .880 copper.

The debased silver weight effectively removed the United States from a bimetalic
standard, while keeping alive the idea of commodity money as gold specie and silver
dollars remained free coinage at standard weight. No longer was free coinage an
option to silver bullion depositors, with the exception of the silver dollar. Even
this provision was prohibited with **The Coinage Act of 1873**,[^2] which eliminated
coinage of the lightweight (412.5 grains) silver dollar in favor of a heavier (420
grains) trade dollar to compete with other countries in the East Asia market.

[^2]: There is still debate as to whether this provision was accidental or intentional.

### Gold Standard

By the end of the century, silver prices had plummetted compared to mid-century values.
Though silver dollar production was reinstated by **The Bland-Allison Act** of 1878,
free coinage of depositor bullion was not. Silver coinage had for some time been
produced with content well-below the coin's face value, rendering it to fiat status.
This was formalized by **The Gold Standard Act** of 1900 in which the United States
dollar was officially fixed at the 1837 standard of 25.8 grains (1.672 grams) of
.900 gold.

Gold specie production continued well into the first quarter of the 20th century,
though by this time the general public had become acustomed to the **representational
money** afforded by Gold and Silver Certificates issued by the United States Treasury.
Backed by physical bullion bars stored in Mint valuts, these certificates could be
redeemed at face value for their equivalent worth in specie. This ended in 1933
with President Roosevelt's **Executive Order 6102**, which required citizens to
surrender all gold specie, bullion, and Gold Certificates in exchange for fiat
currency at the gold standard rate of $20.67 per troy ounce. All gold was removed
from circulation and instead held by the Federal Reserve for backing of Federal
Reserve Notes.

### Junk Silver

With gold coins removed from circulation, and silver and copper coins made subsidiary
by their lower standard weights, the federal coinage was effectively a fiat system--
despite the dollar still being officially pegged to a commodity gold standard. Silver
prices began to rise in the early 1960s, and fractional coins were predicted to once
again be worth more in bullion than face value. **The Coinage Act of 1965** eliminated
all silver content from dimes and quarters, replacing them with a cupronickel outer
layer clad to an inner core of pure copper. The half dollar content was replaced
with an outer layer of .800 silver clad to an inner core of .210 silver (a composite
.400 silver composition); before being changed to that of the dime and quarter in
1971.
