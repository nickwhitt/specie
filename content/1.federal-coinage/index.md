# Federal Coinage

## Coinage Act of 1792

The 2nd Congress of the United States passed **An act establishing a mint, and regulating the Coins of the United States**;
adopting the dollar as the unit basis of federal coinage with a decimal system defining,

> a disme being the tenth part of a dollar, a cent the hundredth part of a dollar, a mille the thousandth part of a dollar.

The coins were to be minted from specific standards of gold, silver, or copper; under the direction of the new US Mint.

| denomination   | value  | metal  | fineness | weight      |
| -------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| eagle          | $10.00 | gold   | 91.7%    | 270 grains  |
| half eagle     | $5.00  | gold   | 91.7%    | 135 grains  |
| quarter eagle  | $2.50  | gold   | 91.7%    | 67.5 grains |
| dollar         | $1.00  | silver | 89.2%    | 416 grains  |
| half dollar    | $0.50  | silver | 89.2%    | 208 grains  |
| quarter dollar | $0.25  | silver | 89.2%    | 104 grains  |
| disme          | $0.10  | silver | 89.2%    | 41.6 grains |
| half disme     | $0.05  | silver | 89.2%    | 20.8 grains |
| cent           | $0.01  | copper | 100%     | 264 grains  |
| half cent      | $0.005 | copper | 100%     | 132 grains  |

Relatively few changes to the original system have since been made. Denominations have been introduced and retired,
while the metal size and weight has been adjusted to meet market (or policitcal) demands. The gold standard was abolished
in 1934, eliminating gold coins from production and circulation; silver coinage was replaced by copper-nickel-clad coins
in 1965.

Today's circulating coinage consists of six denominations, all of which were originally proposed in 1792; though the dollar
and half dollar are rarely encountered.

| denomination   | metal              | composition                     | weight  | diameter | thickness | edge     |

| half dollar    | cupronickel        | 8.33% Ni, balance Cu            | 11.34 g | 30.61 mm | 2.15 mm   | reeded   |
| quarter dollar | cupronickel        | 8.33% Ni, balance Cu            | 5.67 g  | 24.26 mm | 1.75 mm   | reeded   |
| dime           | cupronickel        | 8.33% Ni, balance Cu            | 2.268 g | 17.91 mm | 1.35 mm   | reeded   |
| nickel         | cupronickel        | 25% Ni, balance Cu              | 5.0 g   | 21.21 mm | 1.95 mm   | plain    |
| cent           | copper plated zinc | 2.5% Cu, balance Zn             | 2.5 g   | 19.05 mm | 1.52 mm   | plain    |

## Branch Mints

The US Mint was exclusively located in Philadelphia, even when the seat of government transferred in 1800 to Washington, D.C.
With gold rushes in both North Carolina and Georgia, the US Congress passed the **Mint Act of 1835**, establishing three
additional branches to support production. To distinguish coinage from the four mints, legislation provided for the new mints
to mark all coins with a unique letter, while Philadelphia continued production without this **mint mark**. Two more mints
were later established with the California gold rush and the silver Comstock Lode discovery in Nevada. A government assay
office in Denver was upgraded to mint status in 1906, and the bullion depository at West Point became the most recent branch
mint in 1984.
